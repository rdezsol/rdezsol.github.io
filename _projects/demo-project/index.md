title: HUB PCB
description:  The "HUB" PCB was designed under SJSU Robotics for the University Rover Challenge (URC). HUB works as a telemtry PCB for sampling the voltage and sourced current of the two 40V Li-Ion batteries which power the rover to determine the state-of-charge (SoC). This information is processed by the onboard LPC4078 Micromod and transmitted to an LCD display via I2C. 
skills: 
  - PCB Design 
  - Schematic Capture
  - Datasheet Analysis 
  - SMD/THT Soldering
